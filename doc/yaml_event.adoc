= `yaml_event` module

The `yaml_event` module provides a YAML parser interface.

The parser is started with <<start>>
and then a stream of <<events>> and errors are retrieved
with repeated calls to <<next>>.

[#events]
== Events

The YAML event parser can produce the following events:

[source,erlang]
----
-type yaml_event:event() ::
    {stream, yaml:coord()} |
    {end_of_stream, yaml:coord()}.
----

[#start]
== `yaml_event:start/1`

Start the YAML parser by calling `start/1` with the YAML source as a binary.

[source,erlang]
----
-spec yaml_event:start(Source :: binary) -> yaml_event:state().
----

[#next]
== `yaml_event:next/1`

Calls to `next/1` will return the next event or error
along with the parser state to use in the `next/1` call.

When the parser has finished it will return the `end_of_events` atom.

[source,erlang]
----
-spec yaml_event:next(State) ->
        {event, Event, NextState} |
        {error, Error, NextState} |
        end_of_events
    when
        State :: yaml_event::state(),
        Event :: yaml_event::event(),
        Error :: term(),
        NextState :: yaml_event::state().
